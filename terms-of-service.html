  <h1>Terms of Service</h1>

  <p>Welcome to Kai Funded. By accessing or using our website and services, you agree to be bound by the following terms and conditions. Please read them carefully before making a purchase.</p>

  <h2>1. Services</h2>
  <p>Kai Funded designs and delivers custom-built websites using platforms such as Google Sites, GitHub, WordPress, and Shopify. Clients pay for the custom HTML coding and website development based on their budget and project needs. Most platforms are free to use once the site is coded, but builders like Shopify may require additional subscription costs. Message us on Telegram to find out more and work together to create the best website solution for you.</p>

  <h2>2. Orders & Payment</h2>
  <p>All purchases are processed securely via Stripe. Payment must be made in full before any work begins. Prices are listed in SGD unless otherwise stated. After purchase, clients will receive a confirmation email and be contacted within 24 hours to begin the project.</p>

  <h2>3. Refunds</h2>
  <p>Due to the custom nature of digital services, refunds are not provided once work has commenced.</p>

  <h2>4. Client Responsibilities</h2>
  <p>Clients are responsible for providing necessary materials (e.g., logos, text, product info) and must respond promptly to communication. Delays in response may extend project timelines.</p>

  <h2>5. Intellectual Property</h2>
  <p>Kai Funded retains the rights to original code and design components used across projects. Final websites, once delivered and paid in full, are transferred to the client with full usage rights unless otherwise agreed.</p>

  <h2>6. Modifications & Revisions</h2>
  <p>Each plan includes a fixed number of revisions. Additional changes beyond the plan's scope may incur extra charges, which will be discussed beforehand.</p>

  <h2>7. Limitation of Liability</h2>
  <p>Kai Funded is not liable for damages, data loss, or losses arising from website use, misuse, or downtime after delivery. Hosting and third-party platform policies also apply.</p>

  <h2>8. Changes to These Terms</h2>
  <p>Kai Funded reserves the right to update these Terms at any time. Any changes will be reflected on this page with a new revision date.</p>

  <h2>9. Contact</h2>
  <p>For any questions or concerns, email us at <a href="mailto:thekaifunded@gmail.com">thekaifunded@gmail.com</a>.</p>
